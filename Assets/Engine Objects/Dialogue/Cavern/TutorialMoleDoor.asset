  sentences:
  - The Mole worriedly looks around the bones near the cave-in...
  - He tugs the Weaver and restlessly points forward, wanting the Weaver to get out
    of here quickly.
  - He grabs the Weaver's cloak and gestures to the small cave with the bright yellow
    lantern, hoping the Weaver can help get him there.
