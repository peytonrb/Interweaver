  sentences:
  - ... heh...
  - You know.. I didn't think I'd be this scared. Isn't that pathetic?
  - I said I was going to be the best... that I was going to stand above you.
  - Yet here I am, trembling in my shoes. I can't even begin to shapeshift, damn
    you!
  - 'Why can you do it? Why am I just not good enough. Am I not cut out to be a necromancer? '
  - 'I studied so much... Ran through pile after pile of books. I have an amazing
    ability... yet it is worthless in my hands. '
  - Even then... I don't want to die. I don't want to be forgotten.
  - Weaver... I don't want to look at you. The last thing I want to do is depend
    on you... But...
  - 'Just help me get out of here...


    please.'
