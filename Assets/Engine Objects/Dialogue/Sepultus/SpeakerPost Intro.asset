  sentences:
  - Weaver? Is that you!?
  - What are you doing here!
  - You're looking for your rival? This place is far too dangerous for students!
    You must leave immediately!
  - You've found a Stag familiar? There couldn't be anyone down there except for
    the Wyvern and...
  - ...the student who tried to contain it... I see...
  - Weaver, if anyone could get you and the Rival out of there its the Stag.
  - I trust you'll help them as you've done the other familiars. Be careful young
    Weaver.
