  - The Rival's Wyvern is lingering in this area.
  - 'The Wyvern will not cease to attack you. It has 3 attacks: a fireball, a flamethrower,
    and a magical circle attack.'
  - 'Be sure to avoid these attacks. The Wyvern is powerful, and a single hit will
    severly impact you. '
  - 'The Wyvern can be damaged with your familiar. Use it to Slam [Space] down on
    the Wyvern after it has been launched from a catapult. '
  - Be safe, young Weaver.
