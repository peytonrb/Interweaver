  sentences:
  - Weaver! It looks like the Stag contains some powerful magic.
  - 'The Stag''s leap ability allows you to jump to great heights. Holding {jump}
    will charge your leap. The more you charge, the higher you jump. '
  - You have a unique connection with this familiar. Hold {swap} and you and your
    familiar will magically swap places.
  - Good luck, young Weaver.
