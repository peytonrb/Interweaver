  - 'There is one familiar that exists here in the Underworld, the Stag. '
  - 'The Stag has 3 abilities: a Leap, a Ground Pound, and a Swap abilitiy. '
  - 'The Leap ability allows you to jump to great heights. Holding Space [A] will
    charge your leap. The more you charge, the higher you jump. '
  - 'The Stag can Ground Pound by tapping Space [A] while airborne. This will cause
    the Stag to rapidly fall and generates a shockwave that breaks some objects. '
  - 'Finally, you will find that you have a unique connection with this familiar.
    Hold E [B] and you and your familiar will magically swap places. '
  - 'See if you can find a use for these abilities, none have been successful. '
