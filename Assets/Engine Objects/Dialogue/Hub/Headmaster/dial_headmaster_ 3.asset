  - You've left me particularly speechless this time, young Weaver.
  - You've accomplished something that I've long thought impossible. To achieve what

  - 'Worry not about your rival. She will face her consequences but I am not overly
    cruel. '
  - Now, the time to celebrate is near. I hope you're looking forward to your graduation!
