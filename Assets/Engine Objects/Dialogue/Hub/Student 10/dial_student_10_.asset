  - I've got a story for you. Here goes...
  - "So a moth goes into a podiatrist\u2019s office, and the podiatrist says,"
  - "\u201CWhat seems to be the problem, moth?\u201D"
  - And the moth says,
  - "\u201CWhat\u2019s the problem? Where do I begin, man? I go to work for Gregory
    Illinivich, and all day long I work.\""
  - "\"Honestly doc, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing anymore.\""
  - "\"I don\u2019t even know if Gregory Illinivich knows. He only knows that he
    has power over me, and that seems to bring him happiness.\""
  - "\"But I don\u2019t know, I wake up in a malaise, and I walk here and there\""
  - And the podiatrist says,
  - '"Oh yeah?"'
  - And the moth goes,
  - '"Yes."'
  - And he goes,
  - "\"At night I\u2026I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed
    that\u2019s on my arm. A lady that I once loved, doc.\""
  - "\"I don\u2019t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the\u2026in
    the cold of last year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us.\""
  - '"And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc."'
  - "\"My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch\u2026\""
  - '"I no longer love him."'
  - "\"As much as it pains me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same
    cowardice that I\u2026\""
  - '"That I catch when I take a glimpse of my own face in the mirror."'
  - "\"If only I wasn\u2019t such a coward, then perhaps\u2026perhaps I could end
    this hellish facade once and for all...\""
  - And he says,
  - "\"Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I\u2019m a moth, just barely
    hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me.\""
  - "\"I\u2019m not feeling good.\""
  - And so the doctor says,
  - "\"Moth, man, you\u2019re troubled. But you should be seeing a psychiatrist.
    Why on earth did you come here?\""
  - And the moth says,
  - '"Because the light was on."'
