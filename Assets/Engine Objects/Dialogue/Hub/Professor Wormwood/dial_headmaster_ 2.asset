  sentences:
  - Excellent job, yet again, Weaver. With each task, you find a new way to surprise
    me and the academy.
  - As much as I wish I could, we unfortunately don't have another familiar available
    at the moment. At least not one up to your skill level quite yet.
  - 'I have other .. matters to attend to. Please wait patiently until we can get
    you your next assignment. '
  - I know you may be impatient to get to your final hurdle, but I must insist that
    you do not meander. It is in your best interest, I assure you.
