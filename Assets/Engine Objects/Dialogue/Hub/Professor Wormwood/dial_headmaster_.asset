  sentences:
  - Welcome, young Weaver. Are you ready to take the final steps in your journey?
    Your final project begins... now!
  - I've set up training stations for you to hone your unique abilities, you'll find
    those in the back corners of our classroom straight ahead.
  - I highly recommend you explore what you're capable of before going out into the
    world!
  - Once you feel ready, look closely at the blackboard at the back of the class.
    Focus in on one of the portals to be guided to the familiar of those lands.
  - This will not be a simple task. These familiars are stuck there for a reason.
    They will not follow your word without being given a good reason.
  - Now go forth and take the first step to becoming a fully... fledged... Necromancer!
