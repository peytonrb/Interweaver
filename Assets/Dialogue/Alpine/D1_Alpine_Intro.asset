  sentences:
  - I've spoken on these crystals before, but your two bodies will interact with
    them in different ways. Your threads will also connect to these crystals and
    combine them with another object.
  - Your threads and possession abilities will guide you to this resident of the
    skies. Good luck young necromancer.
