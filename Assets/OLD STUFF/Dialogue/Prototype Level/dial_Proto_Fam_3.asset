    Alrighty now we''ve got our falling islands prototype. In our first level
    the Owl will have to interact with the crystals on these floating islands to
    send them falling down to the weaver


    The weaver can bring those islands
    to wind spots to send them back to the Owl, creating a form of puzzle communication
    between the two.
